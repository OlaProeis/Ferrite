# Ferrite Roadmap

## Known Bugs 🐛

### High Priority
- [ ] **Rendered mode editing bug** - When editing items in rendered mode, only the first item changes. Raw mode works correctly.
- [ ] **Search in files scroll** - Clicking a search result opens the file but doesn't scroll to the match location.

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Search panel scaling** - Search in files panel sometimes renders outside viewport (top/bottom clipping).
- [ ] **Light mode visibility** - Some UI elements need better contrast in light mode. Add separator line between editor and tabs.

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Tab menu icons** - Improve icon organization and visual clarity in the tab context menu.
